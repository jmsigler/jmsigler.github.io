        		<h1>About</h1>
				<p> Hello, my name is Jacob Sigler. I am an electrical engineering student at the University of Michigan. I am mainly interested in rockets and electronics (checkout the project page for various combinations of the two). I am involved in two project teams here at Michigan, Michigan Aeronautical Sciences Association (MASA) and Michigan Exploaration Labratory.</p>
				
				<p> MASA is a student rocketry team, which competes in the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition, which will be held at Spaceport America this year as the Spaceport America Cup. I serve as the chief engineerin on MASA, mainly responsible for coordianting the rocket's build process with the other leads. I also contribute to the avonics team, where I've been working on a flight computer, which will give us more flexibility in the flight data we record.</p>
				
				<p> MXL is a Cubesat team, which has developed cubesats for JPL and is currently working on twin cubesats for a SRI International mission. On MXL, I am a member of the attitude determination and control team, where I've been working on a board to control the satellite's reaction wheels.</p>
